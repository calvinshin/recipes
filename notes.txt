Notes about what I want to make:

Use a mongo database to create recipes (as each recipe will have uncertain parameters with different amounts)
- Could be a SQL database that stores arrays, but will try to use mongoose as a way to practice this
- Question is it easier to store ingredients as a separate object and connect them as relations, or is it easier to keep them separate.
-- Questions to ask others to understand if it's worthwhile to connect or not.
- Creating a separate object would make it easier to store information about the ingredient (for nutritional purposes, for example)


Recipe Keys:
- Steps
- ingredients
- Source
- Pictures, if any
- Notes as a separate field (that could store multiple notes)
- Tags for the recipe
-- Type of cuisine
-- Meal/Dessert/etc.

Other items that need to be built
- A way to store changes to steps/recipe itself
- A way to upload information on front end and store in the backend
- A way to backup the data...?
- A way to login to make changes/edits that are stored in Heroku as variables
